# JEST TESTING 

Jest is a Javascript testing framework that allows us to check correctness in our code and allows you to write tests with an easy and understandable manner that gives you results quickly. 

Some Top Features we get in Jest Testing

- SnapShot Testing - Snapshot is used to track changes in UI. Snapshot testing captures code of a component at a specific time to compare it to a reference snapshot stored alongside the test.

- Out-of-the-box Ease - It adds coverage when invoking Jest to get coverage reports from your tests with the ability to choose between a few built-in reporters or custom ones.

- InterActive Mode - The “interactive way” is more elegant and convenient. Without editing your test code you can limit the tests to run in different ways.

- Debugging Jest tests with VSCode - Run tests directly by saving the file. View any snapshots created by Jest. View any errors in the test and see on which lines the errors have occurred. Have IntelliSense support and write tests much quicker with autocomplete
